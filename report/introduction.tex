\section{Introduction}

Due to the massive increase of news articles in the internet,
the importance of topic analysis and issue tracking is growing.
However, the massive amount of data makes people hard to do the work manually,
so the automatic process held by the machine is needed.
In this paper, we suggest an automatic news analysis process, which consists three steps:
\textit{1. trend analysis}, \textit{2. on-issue event tracking}, and \textit{3. off-issue event tracking}.
After the experiment, we see that our trend analysis model clusters the news articles by topics
very well, and event tracking models find out the events for each issue(topic).
