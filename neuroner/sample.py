sample_txt1 = "South Korea\u2019s Marine Corps on Thursday announced a plan to establish a new command dedicated to protecting border islands, pledging to defend the sea border against North Korea\u2019s potential attacks and infiltration attempts. In its report to a parliamentary audit Thursday, the Marine Corps said the new command will be built around 2020 and based on the current Northwestern Island Defense Command. It was formed in 2011 following North Korea\u2019s artillery attack on Yeongpyeong Island, one of the farmost islands in the west sea. \u201cNot only do we focus on the northwestern island, the Marine Corps will seek to expand the command into a new defense command for strategic islands,\u201d said Marine Corps\u2019 commander Gen. Jun Jin-goo. \u201cWe will seek to establish a unified command structure for strategic islands in the west, east and south sea.\u201d Marine Corps\u2019 commander Gen. Jun Jin-goo (Yonhap)The announcement came amid North Korea\u2019s increasing threat against South Korea\u2019s border areas. In August, Pyongyang revealed its military training designed to seize Yeongpyeong Island and its nearby Baengnyeong Island. Some lawmakers voiced concerns that if North Korea feels confident about its nuclear and missile advantage against South Korea, it might try to forcefully occupy those near-border islands. Last week, South Korea\u2019s Defense Minister Song Young-moo acknowledged that it is a plausible scenario. Asked about those eventualities, South Koreas\u2019 Navy chief Admr. Um Hyung-sung on Thursday pledged a strong response, saying the military would treat the North\u2019s occupation attempt as an \u201call-out war situation.\u201d \u201cIn the event of the enemy\u2019s provocations, front-line units can\u2019t afford to judge whether this is a localized skirmish or an all-out war. We will retaliate as if it is an all-out war,\u201d Um told lawmakers. \u201cWe have maintained a robust readiness posture.\u201dThe Marines Corps said it would establish a unit to defend Dokdo, a set of islets in the east that have been the subject of a territorial dispute with Japan. Dubbed the \u201cUlleung unit\u201d -- named after the island near Dokdo -- the unit will interdict infiltration attempts near the water. The Marine Corps seeks to build the unit by 2020. In a bid to build an \u201caggressive operation\u201d against North Korea\u2019s provocations, the Navy also announced a plan to create a new maneuver fleet and an aviation command by 2023. If formed, the new fleet will include several 6,000-ton KDDX Aegis destroyers and three additional 7,600-ton KDX-III Aegis destroyers. The KDDX ships, which will be built in the mid-2020s, are to be equipped with an advanced ballistic missile defense system and ship-to-surface missiles.\u201cWe will focus on improving our capability to strike the North Korean leadership and core targets inside (the North\u2019s) ballistic missile operation area,\u201d the Navy said in its report for the parliamentary audit. \u201cWe will focus on improving sea-based anti-missile operations.\u201d By Yeo Jun-suk (jasonyeo@heraldcorp.com)"

The Seoul Central District Prosecutors\' Office cited "insufficient" proof to substantiate the allegations that Cho siphoned off 3 billion won ($2.7 million) from company funds to pay for his house remodeling expenses between May 2013 and August 2014.It is the second time the prosecution has rejected the police\'s request for the writ in less than a month. This photo, taken on Sept. 19, 2017, shows Hanjin Group Chairman Cho Yang-ho appearing at a police station in Seoul for questioning. (Yonhap)"We have dismissed the second request as we judge that what the police have so far investigated is insufficient to substantiate the allegations," a prosecution official told reporters, declining to be named.Cho, who doubles as CEO of South Korea\'s top airline, was questioned by police in September. He has denied any wrongdoing, saying he had no knowledge of the misappropriation. The allegations were raised during a separate police investigation into possible tax fraud by an interior renovation company that works largely for business conglomerates. In early July, police investigators raided the airline\'s headquarters in western Seoul and confiscated accounting books and contract documents. (Yonhap)'
